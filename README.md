# an-array-of-spanish-words

An array of ~250,000 Spanish words. Works with Node and Browserify.

I found the list in this repo: https://github.com/ManiacDC/TypingAid. I'm not
sure of it's origin, but it's the most extensive Spanish word list I could find.

To use the module in Javascript code, install it locally:

Then:

var funWords = words.filter(function(w) { return !!w.match(/^fun/i) })
console.log(funWords)
